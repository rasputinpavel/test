Headline: Google gets the US government’s green light to acquire Wiz for $32B

Text Body:
Google’s $32 billion acquisition of cloud security company Wiz has moved a step closer toward the finish line.

Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport said at a Wall Street Journal event on Tuesday, as reported by Reuters , that the acquisition had cleared its antitrust review by the U.S. Department of Justice. Rappaport added that while a milestone, the deal still has a way to go before it officially closes.

Google initially approached Wiz in 2024 with an offer to buy the startup for $23 billion. Wiz walked away from that offer and Rappaport said, at the time, that he felt the business could grow to be a lot bigger than that.

He was right. Google and Wiz revived acquisition talks in the first few months of 2025 , and Google announced it was buying Wiz for $32 billion in March.

Bloomberg initially reported that the deal was under antitrust review in June. The deal is expected to close in early 2026, according to Reuters.
