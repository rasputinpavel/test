Headline: Spotify now lets you see weekly listening stats

Text Body:
Spotify has rarely given its users much visibility into their listening habits. So far, users either had to link their account to services like Last.fm to track their music, or wait until the end of the year for Spotify to release its personalized year-in-review, Wrapped, to find out what they listened to.

The streaming giant is now changing that with a new feature called “Listening stats” that will show users weekly numbers about their listening habits.

Stats will surface your top artists and top songs for a particular week, and will let you share those numbers with others using Instagram or WhatsApp, or with your friends directly on Spotify through the app’s new messaging feature . Spotify said the weekly highlights will also include special moments, like a milestone, a new discovery, or a fan moment.

The stats page also has an option to create a playlist based on the songs you already like and what you might want to listen to next based on your listening habits.

To access your stats, tap on your profile image, and then select the “Listening stats” tab. From there, you will be able to check out what you’ve been listening to, and share the stats.

Listening stats is currently rolling out to free and premium users in over 60 countries. Spotify said it will still release annual recaps via Wrapped, which is usually highly anticipated , as users get to share each other’s top artists and other insights.

The new listening stats might give users a better understanding of their listening patterns on a more regular basis, but it might kill the surprise element of discovering some tidbits about themselves at the end of the year.
