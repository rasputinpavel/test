Headline: Perplexity to pay Snap $400M to power search in Snapchat

Text Body:
Snap said on Thursday that it has signed a deal to integrate Perplexity’s AI search engine directly within Snapchat. As part of the deal, Perplexity will pay Snap $400 million in cash and equity.

The deal gives Perplexity exposure to more than 940 million Snapchat users, who will get answers from its AI engine when they ask questions to the company’s My AI chatbot .

The new feature will be integrated into the app’s interface early next year. Snap said it will start recording revenue from this deal in 2026.

The deal was announced alongside Snap’s Q3 2025 results. The company reported revenue of $1.51 billion, up 10% from a year earlier, though it narrowed its loss to $104 million from $153 million a year ago. The company said its subscription tier, Snapchat+ , now has more than 17 million users.
